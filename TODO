 - New current task: make a new graph
 - Also: dragging a chart around should save it
 - Clicking on a chart should flip it over
 
 sg = {
   :dashboard_id => d.attributes[:id],
   :position => {
     :top => 0,
     :left => 0,
     :height => 7,
     :width => 20
   },
   :window => 240,
   :granularity => "minute",
   :series => [
     {
       :kind => "candle",
       :color => "blue",
       :source => {
         :collection => "mouth_auth",
         :kind => "timer",
         :key => "authentications"
       }
     }
   ]
 }
 
 To make a new graph, the minimum amount of information we need:
  (dashboard id: we have this, it's the current dashboard)
  (position: let's just position it automatically)
  (window/granularity: leave blank!)
  Need to pick which Chart to display from a list
  Maybe choose a fucking color
