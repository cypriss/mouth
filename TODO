Someday
 - Picker:
   - When you re-pick sources, it should scroll to the existing picked items
   - Selected rows should also be highlighted in addition to checked
   - should show a little sparkline or some sense of how old the data is
   - Source picker textbox filter
   - Manual refresh source list icon
 - Graphing
   - Restructure charting code to not remove everything when updating with new data
 - Plugin system
   - 'Dashboards' should be a module
   - 'Explorer' module
   - 'Monitor' module

Bugs:
 - When picker is open, changing dashboards should hide picker
 - tooltip spawns multiple copies on large datasets

Refactorings:
 - reconcile naming of 'sources' sometimes being array of strings and sometimes array of objects
