Now
 - Speed improvements for prod
 - Make sure that if you change dashboards, we don't poll for data on other dashboards

Next
 - Cookie-ize the timespan settings
 - Re implement graph autoplacement
 - Better backend impl of source list
 - Figure out how dashboards can scroll
 - Show period averages / rates
 - Full keyboard navigation
 - Build in some mechanisms to diagnose mongo connection issues
 - Auto refreshing source list (every minute?)
 - More Tests
 - Figure out time zones

Someday
 - Picker:
   - When you re-pick sources, it should scroll to the existing picked items
   - Selected rows should also be highlighted in addition to checked
   - should show a little sparkline or some sense of how old the data is
   - Source picker textbox filter
   - Manual refresh source list icon
 - Graphing
   - Restructure charting code to not remove everything when updating with new data
 - Plugin system
   - 'Dashboards' should be a module
   - 'Explorer' module
   - 'Monitor' module

Bugs:
 - When picker is open, changing dashboards should hide picker
 - tooltip spawns multiple copies on large datasets

Refactorings:
 - reconcile naming of 'sources' sometimes being array of strings and sometimes array of objects
