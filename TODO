V1
 - Auto-update of data
 ------
 - Re implement graph autoplacement
 ------
 - Figure out how dashboards can scroll
 ------
 - better backend impl of source list
 - Figure out how clicking on different dashboards changes the URL, maybe using push state?
 - Make mouth set procline with # of udp packets it has received
 - NEED TO MAKE SURE the collections we generate have indexes on them
 - Great readme
 -  Example files for how to record metrics in various languages
   - Ruby, php, python, .NET
   - mouth-instrument
 - statsd instrument compatibility
 - Add in the *option* (somehow) to display times in current time zone OR UTC
 

V2
 - Select time ranges, and aggregate into 15-minute chunks
 - Show period averages / rates
 - Full keyboard navigation
 - Build in some mechanisms to diagnose mongo connection issues
 - Auto refreshing source list (every minute?)
 - Tests

Someday
 - Picker:
   - When you re-pick sources, it should scroll to the existing picked items
   - Selected rows should also be highlighted in addition to checked
   - should show a little sparkline or some sense of how old the data is
   - Source picker textbox filter
   - Manual refresh source list icon
 - Graphing
   - Restructure charting code to not remove everything when updating with new data
 - Plugin system
   - 'Dashboards' should be a module
   - 'Explorer' module
   - 'Monitor' module

Bugs:
 - When picker is open, changing dashboards should hide picker
 - tooltip spawns multiple copies on large datasets

Refactorings:
 - reconcile naming of 'sources' sometimes being array of strings and sometimes array of objects
