Make mouth set procline with # of udp packets it has received
Build in some mechanisms to diagnose mongo connection issues


 
 To make a new graph, the minimum amount of information we need:
  (dashboard id: we have this, it's the current dashboard)
  (position: let's just position it automatically)
  (window/granularity: leave blank!)
  Need to pick which Chart to display from a list
  Maybe choose a fucking color

NEED TO MAKE SURE the collections we generate have indexes on t

-----------------------------------

-K option to kill previous running version

Config file to read mongo info from

Great readme

Update -h options to display helpful information

Example files for how to record metrics in various languages
 - Ruby, php, python, .NET


$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.expand_path(`pwd`.chomp + '/lib')
require 'mouth/endoscope'
Mouth.mongo = Mongo::Connection.new("localhost").db("mouth")


In order to start the web UI:

bin/mouth-endoscope -F


Ok what do i need to do.

 - Seven library
   - Mouseover shows data values + date, ala shart
   - subtle axis, subtle tix, 5px margin
   
   - MS chart
     - primary line + std dev bands
     - support missing values
   
   
   
   - Mouth graphing:
     - v1: only 1 series per graph
     - timing graphs maybe show a bottom activity graph?
     
     
   - Future tech:
     - Restructure the code to not remove everything when updating with new data
     - Need to be able to shift Y scale without clobbering the graph.
     - 

Graph is:
sg = {
   :dashboard_id => d.attributes[:id],
   :position => {
     :top => 0,
     :left => 0,
     :height => 7,
     :width => 20
   },
   :kind => 'counters' || 'timer',
   :sources => [
     {
       :collection => "mouth_auth",
       :key => "authentications"
     }
   ]
 }
