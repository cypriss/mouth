## Introducing Mouth

Mouth is a Ruby daemon that collects metrics via UDP and stores them in Mongo.  It comes with a modern UI that allows you to view graphs and create dashboards of these statistics.  Mouth is very similar to [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) + [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) + [Graphene](http://jondot.github.com/graphene/).

## Why

Why duplicate effort of the excellent StatsD / Graphite packages?  I wanted a graphing and monitoring tool that offered:

* **Accessible data**.  Because the metrics are stored in Mongo, they are very accessible to any scripts you want to write to read and act on your data.
* **Easy installation**.  Mouth depends on just Ruby and Mongo, both incredibly easy to install.
* **Modern, friendly UI**.  Mouth graphs are beautiful and easy to work with.  Exploring data and building dashboards are a joy.

## What it Can Do

With a few lines of instrumentation in your Rails app, you can collect counters and timers for all your controller actions.

## How it Works

When you write this ruby code in your app ____, it fires off this UDP packet: _____.  This goes to the mouth collector daemon, which aggregates it at minute granularity.

## Data Store

## Scriptable

## User Interface

## How we use it

## Future

Mouth is just at its infancy.  I have a long list of improvements to make to it, ranging from general usability tweaks.  Gauges are next, plus a list of usability tweaks and performance improvements.  Eventually, I hope to implement a plugin system to enable a huge range of functionality.  I would, of course, love your help to make this happen!  The project is at [GitHub](http://www.github.com/cypriss/mouth) -- fork away, or contact me directly via email at jonathan at uservoice, and we can collaborate.
